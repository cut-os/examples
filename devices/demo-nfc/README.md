# CUTOS lwa-template


## Introduction

CUTOS provides the development, operation and management functions of LWA (Local Web Application) applications based on Web technology.
LWA can be built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, or implemented using web frameworks such as Vue, React, Angular, Backbone, etc.

## Prerequisites

To use CUTOS, you need to install Node.js. We recommend that you use the version >=16 available.

To check that Node.js was installed correctly, type the following commands in your terminal client:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
